                            After a major slump in almost all the fields of our country due to extended
                            lockdowns across the globe, economies are slowly taking their first step towards
                            returning to normal and an integral part of that process would be going
                            “Contactless”, as much as possible and viable. Deep-Tech solutions will potentially
                            boom as the most effective and convenient bridge in that. Utilizing technology in the
                            best possible way is much needed these days, especially during post covid times.
                            Fast rising demands with rejuvenation of business does not help solve problems.
                            Therefore the major objective of this ideathon is to bring in innovations and efficient
                            solutions to curb the challenges posed by the post pandemic haul.

                        <p>On a bigger note, standards of living are elevated by the manufacturing sector. It helps
                            in contributing a larger scale for the overall economy. It is an all time working sector
                            which plays an important role considering our existence. But the sector has faced a
                            major fall down as the covid situation never gave space for manpower. Coming back to
                            its usual rate and to cope up with the needs, it is mandatory for innovations to enhance
                            the labour.</p>
                            <p>While workers are back in form after having a longer break, it is important to give them
                                external power through innovations . Also it is significant to bring up the small scale
                                industries and to set up a smart manufacturing unit. Collectively the unit is in need of
                                mass workers but with overcoming the challenge of social distancing. These are the
                                areas that needs technical assistance to be worked on.</p>

                                        Economies all over the world are ramping back up . The post covid
scenario has presented several unique challenges to the manufacturing sector.
Billions of people around the globe are dependent on resilient supply chains and
timely delivery of essential products. With the need for the goods on the rise , the
requirement of employees on the field have also surged up. This raises a serious
issue , that is to ensure that goods being produced are manufactured under safe and
sanitized conditions when delivered to the consumers. This calls for the
development of a system that curbs such challenges and helps us mitigate this
tough time with smart solutions.

                                        The pandemic has affected all sectors of the society and amongst the major
ones affected were the manufacturing lines. It has elevated some serious
issues and the predominant one is the labour procuring , especially for small
scale industries, as the labourers are mostly sourced from adjoining
states.With industries fastly picking up pace the labour and resource
availability are not on the same track. The outbreak has caused a large
amount of temporary labour to migrate to various places, mainly hometowns,
to settle for another occupation. Thus labour shortage is hitting both
industrial and non industrial sectors. While some industries are facing this
issue , few labourers are unable to return citing various reasons , and this
decreased the labour engaging rate drastically down the graph. Thus
solutions addressing these problems are welcomed widely.

automation has not been able to substitute at large scale as shown by COVID 19. This
pandemic may and should serve to accelerate the adoption of smart technologies
and methodologies fostering smart manufacturing. Companies are gradually
realizing the convenience of machine to machine communication and connectivity
across the value chain, especially remote monitoring and real-time control of the
manufacturing shop floor. With the gradual uptake of smart automation in many
companies, there's an unprecedented complexity of safety risks exposed to the
operators of the production facilities. The traditional safety assessments are now
inadequate. Concept of smart safety arises to handle the new challenges. Real-time
safety assessments, Interoperability validation, cyber security and functional safety
becomes the new hygiene factors. Providing alternate solutions or systems and
ensuring work safety at the same time for such industries will move businesses and
the economy in a better way.

                        <p>While the concern of the whole world is associated with health, we have various challenges in the area of health care. Recovering back from the pandemic situation not only involves in increasing the recovery rate but it also includes in taking care of health expanse. Since we are in the mid of contagious diseases, non contact and virtual hospital system should be in charge. Detecting illness in a safer manner is also needed. </p>
                            <p>So as to achieve the requisite, technology has to play an important role.

                                        Virtual health is a key component of our future of health vision. Virtual health
has the capacity to inform, personalize, accelerate, and augment prevention
and care. And now with the ongoing post pandemic scenario , going
contactless is paramount . Health care sector stands as the frontline in saving
people almost everyday , safety and hygiene in such a field cant be
compromised. The best way to approach healthcare in such situations is to
develop a virtual health care system. Virtual health also gives health
stakeholders patients the ability to share data and content and perform
personalized interactions remotely. This can allow for convenient, high-quality
access to care that can enhance provider-patient interactions. In addition,
virtual health-facilitated robotics and automation can help relieve clinicians of
mundane, administrative, or routine tasks, giving them more opportunities to
practice at the top of their license. Thus any system fostering virtual health
care would serve as a boon for the future of this sector.

coronavirus, and some studies have estimated that roughly fivefold
protection is needed to curb the spread. Disposal of these masks is also
uncontrolled today. With people getting back to normal, masks are critical
especially for healthcare professionals, the elderly, the affected individuals,
individuals who are taking care of the infected and to those who are in close
proximity to the infected. As their availability is scarce and limited, it calls for a
possible solution and design of washable and reusable masks and as they are
demanded by people of different economic backgrounds, they should be
made affordable and reusable, as it is proven that detergents and soaps kill
the protein fats of the virus cells and make them ineffective.

doses are being given , hygiene still holds its place in preventing another
major outbreak of the virus. This calls for the hygiene of the hospitals to be
taken seriously. Keeping hospitals clean is a crucial patient safety issue. The
importance of the hospital environment in patient care has only recently
been recognized widely in infection prevention and control (IPC). Although
the available literature is limited, there is enough evidence to demonstrate
that cleaning hospitals helps prevent infections. Thus advanced tech
solutions to ensure hygiene of hospitals are in need of the hour to mitigate
the challenging situation.

                            appreciated because they involve less effort and are more feasible. Also when it
                            comes to the process of recovering back, smart projects play a major role. Energy
                            saving being its utmost concern and making things available in a better way is the
                            motive of smart plans. For example, in the near future we may have to face elections
                            which call for the crowd , we must find solutions to progress the elections. Keeping
                            in mind all such situations, hoping to witness more smart projects.</p>

                        <p>The pandemic letting its damage on every single area did not even exclude
						education. People who prefer soft copies over hard copies are having a good time.
						Online classes are a threat to students. Online classes lack effectiveness and fail to
						connect with the students. We are in the urge of finding out an innovative solution
						comprising both online and offline modes for the betterment of students. Also we
						are in the need of educating the students to handle such situations in the near
						future. Considering the challenge put before, solutions are appreciated.</p>

                                        The post pandemic scenario poses several challenges in all walks of society
										including education. In order to keep education running, educational
										institutions have had to quickly adapt to the situation. With educational
										institutions functioning back to normal, intelligent collective actions need to
										be taken to ensure the safety of the students. Precautionary measures which
										include complete sanitation , social distancing, contactless classroom culture
										have to be enforced blended with advanced ed - tech concepts to bring in a
										progressive approach to education.

                                        The Covid-19 pandemic raging around the globe has caused large-scale
										institutional and behavioural ‘shock effects’ in various areas of human activity
										including education. What most of us consider normal has already
										fundamentally shifted. The classroom culture took a rapid change towards
										getting digitized. While students are having a tough time coping up with
										lectures online , it also brings in serious health issues. Even after pandemic is
										over it is predicted that 40% of the classes will happen from home. This brings
										us to the big picture that we are in need of ed tech solutions to ensure
										efficient lecture delivery, by not compromising student’s health also.
